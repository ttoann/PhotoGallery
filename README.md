Project: Photo Gallery

## Project Overview

This Photo Gallery App is built using Jetpack Compose, focusing on interactive features and clean architectural design. It offers users a seamless experience for browsing, viewing, and managing a collection of photos with a sleek and responsive UI.

## Key Features

- **Photo Grid with Clickable Thumbnails**  
  A grid layout powered by LazyGrid presents photo thumbnails. Tapping an image opens it in a full-screen view.

- **Full-Screen Photo Viewer with Navigation**  
  Displays selected images in full view with intuitive buttons to move between photos, showcasing effective UI navigation and state management.

- **Floating Action Button (FAB)**  
  A floating action button enables quick access to key features like uploading images or opening settings, using Compose’s FAB component.

- **Gesture Controls**  
  Implements common gestures such as swiping to switch images, pinching to zoom, and long-press actions for favoriting or deleting photos using Compose gesture tools.

## Advanced Concepts & Learning Outcomes

- **MVVM Architecture and State Handling**  
  Adopts the MVVM pattern with `ViewModel` and `LiveData` to ensure a clean, scalable architecture and efficient state control.

- **Optimized Performance**  
  Integrates Coil for smooth image loading and leverages lazy loading to efficiently handle large photo collections.

- **Custom Animations & Responsive Layout**  
  Uses Compose’s animation APIs to create engaging UI effects like transitions and zoom. Designed to adapt well across various screen sizes.

- **Optional Device Integration**  
  May include features like taking photos directly with the device camera or using Room to store metadata for offline use.

## Tech Stack

- Jetpack Compose  
- MVVM Architecture  
- ViewModel & LiveData  
- Coil (image loading)  
- Room (optional for local data storage)  
- Compose APIs for gestures and animations  

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, the goal is to strengthen skills in:
- Building modern Android UIs with Jetpack Compose  
- Handling gestures and user interactions  
- Designing scalable, maintainable architectures  
- Creating responsive layouts and optimizing app performance
